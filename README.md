# Using Deep Learning to Identify Similarities Between Two Dolphins in Digital Images

Deep learning is a very popular machine learning technique used these days in many fields and tasks, especially in areas of computer vision. In this project, we would be using these Deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional and Siamese Neural Networks to find similarities between dolphins in digital images in order to help cetacean researchers in cataloguing dolphins.
